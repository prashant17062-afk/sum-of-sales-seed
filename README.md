Sales Summary Application

**Summary**
This project delivers a single-page web application designed for academic grading, which fetches sales data from a `data.csv` file, calculates the total sales, and displays the sum on the page. The application utilizes modern web standards, includes Bootstrap 5 for a clean and responsive user interface, and dynamically updates the page title and content using JavaScript.

**Setup**
To set up and run this application:
1.  Ensure you have `index.html` and `data.csv` in the same directory. The `data.csv` file must contain a header row with a column named 'sales' and subsequent rows with numeric sales values.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). No web server is strictly required for local execution as `fetch` can access local files, but hosting on a simple local server (e.g., Python's `http.server`) is recommended for robust testing in some browser environments.

**Usage**
Upon opening `index.html`, the application will automatically:
1.  Display a "Loading..." message and a spinner while data is being fetched.
2.  Fetch `data.csv` from the same directory.
3.  Parse the CSV content, specifically looking for the 'sales' column.
4.  Sum all the numeric values found in the 'sales' column.
5.  Update the page title to "Sales Summary unique-nonce-123".
6.  Display the calculated total sales amount, formatted to two decimal places, inside the designated `#total-sales` element.

If there are any issues fetching or processing the data, an error message will be displayed instead of the total sales.

**Main Code Logic**
The application's core logic is encapsulated within the `index.html` file:

*   **HTML Structure:** A standard HTML5 document defines the page layout, including a header, main content area, and footer. Bootstrap 5 classes are extensively used for styling to provide a clean and responsive design.
*   **Bootstrap Integration:** Bootstrap 5 CSS is loaded from jsdelivr via a `<link>` tag in the `<head>`, ensuring modern UI components and responsiveness. The Bootstrap JavaScript bundle is also included at the end of the `<body>` for full framework functionality, though not strictly required for this app's current features.
*   **JavaScript for Data Handling:**
    *   An `DOMContentLoaded` event listener ensures the script runs only after the entire HTML document has been loaded and parsed.
    *   An `async` function `fetchAndProcessSalesData()` is used to handle asynchronous operations.
    *   `fetch('data.csv')`: This API call retrieves the CSV file from the server (or local file system).
    *   `.then(response => response.text())`: The response is converted into plain text.
    *   **CSV Parsing:** The `csvText` is split into individual rows and then columns. The script identifies the 'sales' column by its header. It then iterates through the data rows, parses each sales value as a floating-point number, and accumulates the sum. Error handling is included for missing files, empty CSVs, or missing 'sales' columns.
    *   **DOM Manipulation:**
        *   `document.title = 'Sales Summary unique-nonce-123';`: The page's title is dynamically set.
        *   `document.getElementById('total-sales').textContent = `$${totalSales.toFixed(2)}`;`: The calculated total sales amount is inserted into the HTML element with the ID `total-sales`, formatted to two decimal places for currency representation.
    *   Loading indicators (text and spinner) are managed to enhance user experience during data fetching.
