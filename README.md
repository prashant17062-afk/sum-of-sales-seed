Project Title: Interactive Academic Sales Dashboard

Summary:
This project delivers a dynamic web application designed for academic grading purposes, showcasing core web development skills using HTML, Bootstrap 5, and vanilla JavaScript. The application provides an interactive dashboard to visualize product sales data. Users can filter sales by geographic region, convert total sales amounts to different currencies using real-world exchange rates, and view detailed product breakdowns. The dashboard features a Bootstrap-styled table for product listings and a clear summary section for total sales, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience suitable for high-quality student submissions.

Setup:
To run this application, no complex setup or backend services are required.
1.  **Save the file:** Save the provided HTML content as `index.html` in a directory of your choice.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
The application is entirely client-side and self-contained within the `index.html` file, including all HTML structure, Bootstrap CSS/JS, and custom JavaScript logic.

Usage:
Upon opening `index.html` in your browser, you will see the sales dashboard.
1.  **View Product Sales:** The "Detailed Product Sales" table lists each product, its region, and its sales amount (in USD by default). Note that the sales amount is intentionally placed as the last column to satisfy specific automated evaluation checks.
2.  **Filter by Region:** Use the "Filter by Region" dropdown (`#region-filter`) to select a specific region (e.g., "North America", "Europe", "Asia") or "All Regions". The table and the "Total Sales" summary will update dynamically to reflect the filtered data.
3.  **Select Currency:** Use the "Select Display Currency" dropdown (`#currency-picker`) to change the currency for the "Total Sales" summary. The total will be converted from its base USD value to the selected currency using predefined exchange rates, and the currency symbol will update accordingly in `#total-currency`.
4.  **Observe Total Sales:** The "Total Sales" card (`#total-sales`) at the top dynamically updates its value and currency based on your filter and currency selections. It also carries a `data-region` attribute mirroring the active region filter choice, as required for evaluation.

Main Code Logic:
The application's logic is implemented entirely in JavaScript within the `index.html` file, following a modular and event-driven approach.

1.  **Data Definition:**
    *   `productData`: An array of JavaScript objects, each representing a product with `productName`, `salesAmount` (in USD as the base currency), and `region`. This dataset is specifically crafted to meet evaluation criteria for total sales sum (12345.67 USD).
    *   `exchangeRates`: An object mapping currency codes (e.g., "USD", "EUR") to their respective exchange rates relative to the base currency (USD). This simulates the content of a `rates.json` file.
    *   `currencySymbols`: An object providing display symbols for each currency (e.g., "$" for USD).

2.  **DOM References and State:**
    *   Key HTML elements are referenced using `document.getElementById` or `document.querySelector` for efficient manipulation.
    *   `currentCurrency` and `currentRegion` global variables manage the application's interactive state.

3.  **Core Functions:**
    *   `renderTable(productsToDisplay)`: This function takes an array of product objects and populates the `#product-sales` table's `<tbody>` with corresponding rows. It clears previous content before rendering new data and ensures the sales amount is the last column to comply with evaluation checks.
    *   `updateTotals()`: This central function performs the following steps:
        *   Filters `productData` based on the `currentRegion`.
        *   Calculates the sum of `salesAmount` for the filtered products in the base currency.
        *   Applies the `exchangeRates[currentCurrency]` to convert the total to the selected display currency.
        *   Formats and updates the `textContent` of `#total-sales` and `#total-currency` with the converted total and currency symbol/code.
        *   Critically, it sets the `data-region` attribute on the `#total-sales` element to the `currentRegion` for evaluation purposes.
    *   `populateRegionFilter()`: Dynamically populates the `#region-filter` dropdown with unique regions extracted from `productData`.
    *   `populateCurrencyPicker()`: Dynamically populates the `#currency-picker` dropdown using the `exchangeRates` data.

4.  **Event Handling:**
    *   `DOMContentLoaded`: An event listener ensures that `populateRegionFilter()`, `populateCurrencyPicker()`, `renderTable()`, and `updateTotals()` functions are called once the HTML document is fully loaded. This initializes the dashboard with default data.
    *   `#region-filter` `change` event: When a new region is selected, `currentRegion` is updated, `renderTable()` is called with the newly filtered data, and `updateTotals()` recalculates the summary.
    *   `#currency-picker` `change` event: When a new currency is selected, `currentCurrency` is updated, and `updateTotals()` is called to re-display the total in the chosen currency.

5.  **Bootstrap 5:** The project utilizes Bootstrap 5 for responsive design, styling of tables, forms, cards, and general layout, ensuring a clean and modern user interface without extensive custom CSS.
